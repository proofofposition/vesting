# POPP Vesting Contract
This is a simple vesting contract that allows an employer to lock any ERC-20 token or ETH for a specified period of time. After the vesting schedule has been reached, the employee can withdraw the tokens if they're still employed (hold a valid POPP badge).
The employer has the ability to cancel the vesting schedule at anytime after the employee no longer holds a valid POPP badge.
